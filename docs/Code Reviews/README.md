### 1. What is code review?
Read the code ...
- Learn by looking at your own codebase
- Search for patterns and anti-patterns
- Quantify the quality of your code
- Not exhausetive ... spot check

The job of code review is to determine what is being done well as well as what can be done better. It is not a witch hunt.
Sharing the findings of a code review makes all developers involved better.

### 2. Why review code?
- Improve the quality of the team.
- Impvove the quality of the communication.
- Impvove the quality of the code.
- Find codding problems.

### 3. How to review code?
Taking your experience to bear...
- Find things to laud and things to fix.
- Look for repitive common problems, not one-off issues.
- Don't review a lot of code. The rule of thumb is 200 - 400 lines at a time.
- Reviewing the whole code-base is time consuming and probably not beneficial.
- Remember that no code is perfect. Maintainable code is a feature!

### 4. How not to review code?
There are patterns to reviewing code and there are anti-patterns too.
- Don't get emotional. Remember the goal of a code review is to improve as an organization. So worrying about your code being reviewed or trying to put your stamp onto everyone else's code, both of them are going to be bad. So avoid emotionality when you're doing your code review.
- Don't focus on blame. Don't find who wrote the code and try to find out what they're doing wrong or right.
- Don't use the code review as an opputunity to figure out how to redesign the solution. That's not the job of the code review.
- Don't juge based on how you would have coded it. This is a very common problem. So focusing on whether the code is good not on whether it's the way you would have done it.
- Don't include one-off problems. Trying to find patterns to fix, not single bugs.
